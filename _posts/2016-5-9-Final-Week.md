title: Final Week
---

1. **What did you do this past week?** 
Last week I took my last algorithms test and prepared for and completed the final OOP test. Additionally, I finally implemented soft shadows in my game technology game engine.

2. **What is in your way?** 
The semester is over and the only thing left is to finish and turnin my game technology assignment.

3. **What will you do next week?**
This week I will finish my game technology assignment, although I plan to continue working on it after the semester. I have completed everything I originally planned on implementing, however, I will still assist my team in the project and I hope to add “normal maps” or “bump mapping” as a game engine feature.

**My Impressions:**
I learned a great deal and this class and glad I had the opportunity to take it. My experience coding in C++ and the OOP and C++ knowledge I acquired in the lectures and from readings will be an invaluable asset in my career as a game developer.

**Tip of the Week:**
The talks from Game Developers Conference 2016 were recently released and they contain a plethora of knowledge. I have not had time to watch many of them yet, however, I recommend you take a look at some of the [programming topics](http://www.gdcvault.com/browse/gdc-16).
