title: Week Two
---

1. **What did you do this past week?** Last week I set up my accounts and working environment, began working on unit tests and generating acceptance tests, and implemented the simplest solution with a cache.

2. **What's in your way?**  I am being impeded by another project-heavy, course with assignments due every other day. This weekend I drove to Houston to attend a wedding so it was difficult to get on top of my assignments. I hope that this week and next weekend will give me ample time to get ahead on my work.

3. **What will you do next week?** I did not meet my previous goal from last week (finishing the assignment) so I will have to do it before Thursday. I will have two large dedicated periods of time to finish off the assignment today and Thursday.
 
**Tip-of-the-week: _[ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/) is a free agile project management extension that fits right into GitHub. It allows you to create epics, stories, and sub-tasks, view an agile board, and view burndown charts. I have been using it with a team for the project-heavy course I mentioned above. ZenHub can be a little wonky at times (e.g. issues are not always parented under epics on creation even if you mark that they should be), however, the extension gets the job done._**

So far the content in Downing's SWE course has been extremely similar to OOP's. The lectures, quizzes, and readings seem almost identical and the project is the same aside from the fact that we are using Docker to check our work and Python which, because of its relative speed to C++, requires further optimizations. Although Downing posts the lecture notes on Piazza, I miss having them as a Google Doc in one succinct place. Going back to the project, I am happy that Downing is having us fork the repo and make a pull request to enact our changes. I feel like this is a valuable experience, especially for those interested in working with the open source community. I appreciated going through the project specs during class last week, however, I also miss the detailed, numbered specifications provided on each of the assignment pages.

I hope that this course will begin to divide drastically from OOP's content in the upcoming assignments.

On another note I missed turning in this blog post on Sunday this week. I set a reminder on my phone so this does not happen again and I suggest those who have not do so as well.
