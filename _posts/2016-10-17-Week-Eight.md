title: Week Eight

1. **What did you do this past week?** Last week I began looking into hosting a web application on AWS. My team decided to use AWS, as opposed to Digital Ocean because, it seems to be used heavily in industry and some companies actually list it as a requirement or beneficial skill on job applications.

2. **What's in your way?** Programming interviews and lengthy weekly assignments in other classes.

3. **What will you do next week?** Last week my group split up the first assignment into discrete tasks. So far this week, I have completed my own assigned tasks and a little bit more. I setup a webpage on AWS, using Flask, as well as the continuous integration environment for our webpage. Pushing to master or dev will deploy to different AWS environments or webpages.
 
**Tip-of-the-week: _Blizzard has a helpful and in-depth page on [applying for video game development jobs](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/careers/roles/engineering.html). It was created specifically for Blizzard applications. However, the advice can be applied to almost all video game jobs as well as other software engineering roles. It also has a nice section on writing cover letters which is not required for many non-game development positions. However, cover letter requirements are abundant for game dev roles (I have written over a dozen)._**

I have not done very much web development and, without prior knowledge of it, it seems rather intimidating. With the right tutorials and proper documentation, it is quite the opposite. Modern tools and applications have made it simple to create your own scalable, beautiful, database-backed webpage.
