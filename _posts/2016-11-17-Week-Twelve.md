title: Week Twelve

1. **What did you do this past week?** Last week I reorganized the backend project structure and made the unit tests more accessible to the frontend or other operations.

2. **What's in your way?** Illness and a full day programming interview.

3. **What will you do next week?** This week I will write more unit tests, update the wiki, help with database and AWS issues, and do whatever else is necessary to turn in the project.
 
**Tip-of-the-week: _If you are currently struggling through the second computer graphics projects you may find this textbook PDF, [3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game-Development](https://tfetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/F.Dunn-I.Parberry-3D-Math-Primer-for-Graphics-and-Game-Development.pdf) to be particularly helpful. It gives an excellent overview of linear algebra and computer graphics and delves into common intersection tests towards the end of the book._**

This week in class we went over refactoring code and some fundamental OOP principles using Java. Working in/reading Java code makes me miss using C++. I also miss writing out example problems that Downing sometimes provides us in class. I hope that we go back to doing that as opposed to listening to a lecture for the entire 50 minutes. It can be difficult to stay engaged.
