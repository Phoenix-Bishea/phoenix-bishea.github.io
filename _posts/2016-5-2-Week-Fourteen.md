title: Week Fourteen
---

1. **What did you do this past week?** 
Last week I refactored my renderer for game technology to dynamically generate shaders based on user inputs/function calls. On a per entity or game object basis the user can specify rendering parameters for lighting (such as turning shadows on or off).

2. **What is in your way?** 
My internet has been broken for the last three days and it is surprisingly crippling. I am definitely switching to Google Fiber when I receive my installation kit.

3. **What will you do next week?**
This week I will study for my last algorithms test on Wednesday and the OOP test on Friday. I will continue to work on my renderer as well.

**My Impressions:**
I am enjoying learning about the reference counter in class. When Downing first presented the idea through pictures it seemed far more complex than its somewhat trivial implementation. Typically I feel that concepts are far easier to understand than to implement, however, the reference counter in Shape3 was a different story.

**Tip of the Week:**
If you are having trouble when resolving merge conflicts try using the **git merge tool**.  Instead of finding the commit head and number the git merge tool provides a three panel screen with the two conflict files and the proposed resolution. Differences are highlighted red or green and you can press the in file errors to move chunks of code over. When all of the files are equal and you save, the conflict is resolved.
