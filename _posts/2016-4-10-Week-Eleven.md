title: Week Eleven

1. **What did you do this past week?** 
Last week I took my second algorithms exam, finished **Darwin** with my partner, and began planning out my final game technology project. My team and I hope to build the rendering side of a 3d game engine in the context of an FPS game.

2. **What is in your way?** 
No blockers as of right now.

3. **What will you do next week?** 
Next week I will continue working through **OpenGL** tutorials to prepare myself for building the renderer for game tech and I will begin working on the final OOP assignment, **Life**, with my partner. I have already created the private GitHub repo, added the issues, and setup the initial files in my local repo.

**My Impressions:**
I need to plan for extra time at the end of OOP projects to write unit tests. For **Darwin**, my partner and I ended up writing over 100 unit tests. This is an extremely time consuming task and should not be left until the last minute. We ended up turning in the project with only four or five minutes to spare which is a little too close for comfort.

**Tip of the Week:**
Another resource for learning **OpenGL** is [http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/). I have been using this website and [https://open.gl/](https://open.gl/) to brush up on my modern **OpenGL** skills. Although the first website covers a wider variety of material and is easier to get up and running, I prefer the second website because it requires you to set up your dependencies and figure more things out on your own. If you are interested in computer graphics however, I would recommend giving them both a try.
