title: Week Five
---

1. **What did you do this past week?** Last week I finished Project #2: Netflix with my partner. I had several blockers last week so I was unable to devote as much time as I would have liked to improve my RMSE or my rating prediction accuracy. Although the project was very straight forward, turnin was rather stressful. It takes a significant amount of effort to change only a small piece of code and resubmit and assignment in Downing's classes.

2. **What's in your way?** I have no foreseeable blockers this week.

3. **What will you do next week?** Next week I will catch up on missed reading and begin studying for my first exam.
 
**Tip-of-the-week: _If there is a software or technology conference you are interested in attending check and see if they need volunteers. Volunteering at such an event allows you to network with other like-minded individuals, attend the conference for free, and in some instances you get paid._**

We had an awesome speaker in one of our classes this week, Alex Menzies from JPL (aka the people who saved Matt Damon's character in the Martian). Alex discussed some best practices in software engineering and showed us Mars via the Microsoft Hololens. I was very impressed with the speaker as many people Downing brings in to talk only discuss the tools that their companies use which is often uninteresting.
