Last week I began early on the SWE project and lost time because of doing so. Before Downing mentioned the GitHub Classroom repo requirement I had created a repo with my partner and filled it with over 25 issues. We had also made decent headway into the project. We were forced to copy our repo to the new GitHub classroom repo. However, the issues were not copied over in the automated process and we had to manually re-add them by hand. Additionally, we had to stop using the built-in agile development project tool (ZenHub) that we had been using because we could not grant permisions to ZenHub for the classroom repo.
