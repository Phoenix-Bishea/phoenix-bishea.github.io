title: Final Week
---

1. **What did you do this past week?** Last week my group and I prepared and practiced our final presentation. The presentation covered the work that we had completed during the past six weeks of class for our website [partypeople.me](http://partypeople.me/) (the site will likely be offline by the time you read this). The site focused on upcoming political elections and the candidates involved. Most of the improvements we would have liked to have made were user interface related. There were also a few pieces of missing information (e.g. presidential candidates) that we would have liked to have added (the site only covered state elections). 

2. **What's in your way?** Nothing! I have a few assignments to finish in other classes and when I finish those I will officially be on break. 

3. **What will you do next week?** I may work on the extra credit assignment, [Collatz Conjecture on Kattis](https://utexas.kattis.com/problems/collatz), that SWE students will do next semester. 
 
**Tip-of-the-week: _If you have interest in writing your own game engine from scratch instead of using a pre-existing engine, such as Unity or Unreal, I suggest you read this [blog post by Michael Kissner](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MichaelKissner/20151027/257369/Writing_a_Game_Engine_from_Scratch__Part_1_Messaging.php). It provides a decent starting point for an architectural engine design._**

**Course review:**
TL;DR – If you have a lot of time to spare and want to learn about web development and/or python take this class. Be warned that it is time consuming and you will have to manage your time working on a large group.

Downing's SWE course gave me a deeper understanding of python as well as a taste of backend web development. That being said, I did not learn very much about development methodologies for small software engineering teams. The first two projects in the course give students a chance to experiment with python and the final three give students a taste creating a web project with a small team. However, the teams were not heavily encouraged to use any tools to better manage themselves. I think that was the major element lacking in this course. There was no formalized idea of weekly or bi-weekly sprints and there was a loose attempt to teach students about agile development story points, but deeper explanations were not given. Organization was up to an individual team and if that team did not have prior experience doing so, they suffered. Towards the end of the course Downing covers a section on refactoring object-oriented Java code. I think it would have been more beneficial to take that time, earlier in the semester, to teach the class about agile development and to provide students with free tools to better organize themselves. 

This class also introduces the idea of a 'project leader' during the final three team assignments. The leader changes for each assignment, so the leaders do not have time to improve their team's efficiency or to truly get used to their role. I think one leader should be assigned for the entire website project.

If you are thinking about taking this class be wary of mandatory daily quizzes. Downing gives quizzes during each class that are locked with a four-digit pin. At the end of the semester some of your lowest grade quizzes will be dropped unless of course you miss a quiz. In that case, you get a zero on the quiz and it is not dropped. It is considered cheating to give this quiz number to an absent friend. I personally disagree with this philosophy. Downing wants people to attend his classes for their own benefit, however, as adults I think people should be able to make their own decisions about whether they come to class or not. Additionally, there are instances where people are sick, and come to class anyways, or people have job interviewers and are deducted points for missing class (despite being encouraged by Downing to interview for internships). This policy does not make sense to me.

Many of the required weekly readings (which are quizzed upon) are interesting, however, there are far too many for any sane person to keep up with. I was able to keep up towards the beginning of the semester, but as other courses picked up I found myself slipping behind.

Professor Downing has several guest lecturers throughout the semester. A few of them are pretty interesting and have valuable advice to give prospective software engineers, however, many of them just inform you of the technologies they use at their jobs which does very little to educate students (unless you want to work at that company and you don’t know which technologies are used there). If I could help it, I would minimize these types of talks.

Tests for this class are fair, but difficult even with excessive studying. Be warned.

Some of the structuring of this class is a little strange. For instance, Downing lectures on databases and relational algebra after an assignment is due on these topics. It would be nice to learn this information earlier.

Overall I am glad I took this course. I only wished that the structure was a little different and that we had more guidance when it came to team organization for the final three phases of the group project.
