title: Week Six
---

1. **What did you do this past week?** This week I did not do much related to SWE. I was anticipating receiving a review sheet earlier in the week although it probably would have been possible for me to start earlier.

2. **What's in your way?** A weekly agile sprint for my game development capstone course.

3. **What will you do next week?** Tomorrow I will continue studying for the exam on Thursday. I plan to work with a partner going over practice problems and rewriting functions and classes discussed in the course.

I am not a fan of the daily pin-locked quizzes in the course. I understand that Downing uses the pin-lock to encourage people to attend and, in the long run, force them to succeed in the course. However, this does not always work as intended. I feel it is unfair that missed quizzes cannot be dropped (unless a doctor excuses the absence) and that it is cheating to share the pin with another person. Sometimes people have conflicting interviews, family emergencies, or unforeseen circumstances arise. It is counterproductive to punish students for these reasons.
