1. **What did you do this past week?** Last week I reorganized the backend project structure further and wrote many of our group's unit tests. One of my group members changed the API and I helped him make a few minor changes afterwards. Finally I prepared the project for turnin insuring my group had all of the required documents (e.g. coverage, autopep8). 

2. **What's in your way?** Turkey, gravy, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, and other gluttonous pursuits.

3. **What will you do next week?** My group and I need to finish the visualization page and finish planning our presentation. 
 
**Tip-of-the-week: _DirectX 12 is the first Microsoft graphics API that allows multithreaded GPU programming. Microsoft offers extensive documentation [getting started with Direct 12](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn899121(v=vs.85).aspx), however, if you have never used a Microsoft graphics API it can be pretty overwhelming. I have started reading user-created tutorial covering DX12 that does a good job of breaking the new features down while discussing the underlying code. You can find it [here](https://digitalerr0r.wordpress.com/2015/08/19/quickstart-directx-12-programming/)._**

This week we have continued covering slides related to refactoring. On Monday I missed class due to illness. On Wednesday Spiceworks came and spoke. The talk was very similar to others that have covered software engineering in Downing's classes. The difference, however, was the speakers' excitement about the company they worked at and the advice they gave the class at the end of the presentation. At the end of the talk, the two speakers figuratively removed their 'Spiceworks caps' and gave the class some heart-to-heart advice. This made their presentation stand out against many of the rest.
