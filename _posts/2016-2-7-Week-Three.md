1. **What did you do this past week?** 
This week I finished Collatz. I started early on the assignment, but did not work on it very consistently until the end of the project and ran into a few issues understanding the steps online. I ended up spending less time than I estimated though. Now I am just crossing my fingers that nothing will go wrong with my submission and that I did not forget to include something.

2. **What is in your way?** 
Due to external factors, I have gotten pretty far behind on the readings. If I want continue doing well on the quizzes and potentially tests, I will need to catch up on those.

3. **What will you do next week?** 
Next week, as I mentioned earlier, I will catch up on the readings and start looking at the Australian Voting problem. Apparently the key to success in this class is starting early.

**My Impressions:**
I finished the first assignment and towards the end I was stressed as hell. I didn't spend enough time working on it early on. Class has continued to be entertaining and informative. I was called on for the first time and the questions Downing asked me were rather trivial. He had just gone over them multiple times with other students and he mostly asked me if I agreed with him. Nevertheless I still appreciate his teaching method and look forward to the next time I am called upon.

**Tip of the Week:** If you are interested in becoming a professional game developer or looking for a game development internship (in programming or another specialty) [orcahq](https://orcahq.com/jobs) is an excellent resource for current game development job listings.
