title: Week Seven
---

1. **What did you do this past week?** 
Last week I worked with my team to finish my game technology project. I attempted to refactor a large section of the code base. However, as the deadline encroached on us (and features were not yet implemented) the code became more disorganized. We plan to go back and rewrite parts of the game so it is better suited to networking. Aside from finishing the game tech project I studied for the OOP test.

2. **What is in your way?** 
As of right now I have no blockers.

3. **What will you do next week?** 
Next week I begin working on the OOP project with my partner. I plan to get everything setup so we can start programming over the break and the week after.

**My Impressions:**
I felt that this week's test was fair for the most part. I was a little short on time towards the end of the test because of the digits question (other people I spoke to had the same issue). I did not understand how to store the number sequence until after the test. The rest of the test was fairly straightforward.

**Tip of the Week:**
The video game developer's conference (GDC) will be happening in one week. It's a convention where game developers meet up and discuss their experiences from and techniques used in the gaming industry. If you are curious how a game achieves x, y, or z or want to gain some more insight into the industry, you should check out the [programming lectures from the GDC Vault](http://www.gdcvault.com/) (a backlog of former GDC lectures).
