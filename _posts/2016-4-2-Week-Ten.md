title: Week Ten

1. **What did you do this past week?** 
This week I completed weekly algorithms assignment and finished the third project, networking, in my game technology class. Additionally, I created all of the issues and setup the repo and my local directory for the Darwin project.

2. **What is in your way?** 
I haven't been able to invest a ton of time into the Darwin project because of an upcoming algorithms test and the game tech project I just finished.

3. **What will you do next week?** 
Next week I will take an algorithms test on Monday and spend the rest of the week finishing Darwin with my partner.

**My Impressions:**
Although the information presented by the guest speakers last week was not new to me, I really enjoyed the manner in which they presented it. The two speakers seemed to have their presentation down to a tee and provided easy to understand, yet in depth explanations for various software engineering practices. It was interesting hearing from software developers that develops tools FOR software developers and not just one type of tool, but a multitude of them.

**Tip of the Week:**
I have mentioned the _Game Programming Patterns_ book before written by Robert Nystrom, but I wanted to outline a chapter that I used for refactoring my game technology project. This chapter covers and interesting decoupling pattern known as component-based architecture design. The chapter provides a brief overview of the topic, when you would want to use the pattern, a series of small code samples. [Here's the link to the chapter](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html).
