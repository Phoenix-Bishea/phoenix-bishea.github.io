1. **What did you do this past week?** 
Last week I completed my weekly algorithms homework and my partner and I finished our OOP project. We were grateful to have the extra turnin day, because I became very ill in the middle of the week. Life was not a very far deviant from Darwin. I just wish we had covered abstract classes slightly earlier in the course. 

2. **What is in your way?** 
No blockers as of right now.

3. **What will you do next week?**
This week I have a milestone deadline for my game tech project and I will be creating the lighting effects for that. I also hope to begin studying for my final exams happening next week.

**My Impressions:**
I think it is a good practice to write unit tests, however, at the same time I really hate meeting a quota for each assignment. I think it is important to write them for edge cases, but I often find myself writing rather trivial or obvious ones to meet the requirement for each function/method.

**Tip of the Week:**
LinkedIn just released an app for helping students find jobs. Everyday the app shows you cards with information and potential jobs related to your major. It also lets you choose places you would prefer to work. I think itâ€™s worth a try [https://students.linkedin.com/](https://students.linkedin.com/).
