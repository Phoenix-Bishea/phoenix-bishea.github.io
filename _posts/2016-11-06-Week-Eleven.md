title: Week Ten
---

1. **What did you do this past week?** Last week I worked with a partner to make further modifications to our database design and I created our API. I also helped to wrote tests for the API.

2. **What's in your way?** Programming interviews and lengthy weekly assignments in other classes.

3. **What will you do next week?** This week I will reorganize the backend project structure make tests more accessible and the code more modular. I will also determine my responsibilities for the third phase.
 
**Tip-of-the-week: _If you are interested in becoming a professional game developer or looking for a game development internship (in programming or another specialty) [orcahq](https://orcahq.com/jobs) is an excellent resource for current game development job listings._**

Phase two required much more effort than the first phase of the project. Additionally my team and I far underestimated the time required to complete the phase and organization was poor when it came to combining parts of the project. We hope that communication will go more smoothly during the final phase of the project. We plan to work earlier on individual features and to start piecing the project together earlier as well. Ideally the final day of the project should be meant for turnins only.
