1. **What did you do this past week?** 
Last week I worked through a series of OpenGL tutorials to prepare myself for building a 3D Rendering Engine. On Thursday, my team and I planned the renderer's scene graph (a hierarchical represenation of nodes) implemented the ability to load 3D models using [assimp](http://www.assimp.org/) and finished our first draft of the scene graph. We can now rotate, translate, and scale models and attach them as children of one another. My partner and I also started planning our OOP project.

2. **What is in your way?** 
No blockers as of right now.

3. **What will you do next week?** 
This week I will begin working on lighting shaders for the 3D Rendering Engine and I will finish Life (and all of its unit tests) with my partner.

**My Impressions:**
My partner and I had some difficulty drafting out the design for Life, however, I think things will begin fall into place now that we have our design. Part of the problem is that we are not very comfortable with C++ inheritance. I wish we had gone over these concepts earlier in the semester. 

**Tip of the Week:**
Last week I mentioned another resource for learning OpenGL. This week I'm going to talk about another, much better one. This tutorial covers an enormous range of beginning graphics techniques in OpenGL and does a wonderful job of explaining them. When I first started tampering with OpenGL this resource was not very popular and I did not find it until recently. However, I'm glad I found it.
