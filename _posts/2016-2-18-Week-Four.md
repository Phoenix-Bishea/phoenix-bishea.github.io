title: Week Four

1. **What did you do this past week?** 
I had an extremely busy week and weekend with an interview and a coding challenge for a job that asked me to implement a memory manager without including any header files. Additionally my partner and I agreed to not work together as he is flying out for an interview midweek. That being said, I fell a bit behind on the project, but am confident that I will finish on time.

2. **What is in your way?** 
Applying for jobs has taken up a lot of my time that I would normally be using for classes. I am looking for a job in the game industry and many have been posted recently/are still popping up. So I'm in interview/cover letter mode.

3. **What will you do next week?** 
Because my blog post is a bit late... This week I will finish the Voting project and continue to do the readings for class.

**My Impressions:**
I found Ben Porter's talk to be very entertaining and insightful. Main Street Hub sounds like a neat place to work, mostly because of the nerf gun wars (just kidding). I was not aware that Downing invites guest speakers and I am looking forward to the next one.

**Tip of the Week:** I found a neat tutorial series on reddit covering C++ in the context of video games. Some of the beginner lessons may be a bit trivial, however, it's fun trying to do some of the challenge exercises. I have not tried the advanced computer graphics tutorials, but I imagine that they are pretty insightful as well. Here's a [link to the reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2eb5d8/copenglsdl_game_engine_tutorials_for_an_absolute/) if you are interested.
