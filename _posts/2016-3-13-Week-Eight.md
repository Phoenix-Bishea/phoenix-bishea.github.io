title: Week Eight
---

1. **What did you do this past week?** 
I had an extremely busy week inside, but mostly outside, of classes. Aside from my weekly algorithms assignment, I planned the new architecture for my networked video game project, attended a career fair for game development, celebrated a family member's birthday, and programmed a video game demo in Unity for a competition I was asked to participate in a month after the competition had started. I also started the OOP project by completing preliminary steps such as adding all of the issues to GitHub with comments and tags.

2. **What is in your way?** 
As of right now my schoolwork is blocking me fully relaxing over the break and spring break is blocking me from fully committing to my schoolwork.

3. **What will you do next week?** 
Next week I will begin writing the newly architected code for my game technology project, continue working on my OOP project, complete the final round of interviews for a gaming company, and try to enjoy what little break I have left.

**My Impressions:**
Given my workload this week it was a relief to have no class on Friday and a guest speaker on Wednesday. The speaker was friendly and engaging, however, the ideas presented were not particularly novel to me. Many of the skills or ideas he talked about can be acquired or learned from a software engineering internship.

**Tip of the Week:**
Regardless of your position on a team, keep tabs on your fellow member's progress. If a deadline is approaching, a team member is struggling, and you have time to help, help. If not, find someone who can help them. I encountered this exact situation working on a video game demo for a competition this week. The 3D artist/sound engineer fell behind on his work, however, my team and I discovered this too late. The other programmer on my team helped the artist by creating a majority of the 3D models. In the meantime I did what programming I could. However, I ended up getting all of the art and sound assets about four hours before the deadline. As a result, there was not much time to test, debug, and tweak the feel of the game. If my team and I had kept better tabs on our 3D artist, we may have been able to help him out sooner. You can [see the trailer for the demo here](https://youtu.be/t66-PLuU4zs) and [play the demo here](https://fuzzysasquatch.itch.io/wastes). Forewarning, the game has a lot of dialogue and walking and it takes awhile to load. Use WASD to move and the mouse to look around. Interact with highlighted objects by clicking on them.
