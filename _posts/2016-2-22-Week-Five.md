title: Week Five
---

1. **What did you do this past week?** 
Last week I spent all of Thursday implementing voting. Alone. I am looking forward to doing the next project with a partner. While we may run into some hiccups merging (if we ever work separately), I imagine feature implementation and bug fixes will come more smoothly. Regarding the project, I had trouble using the std::sort function as I was unaware that I needed to overload the assignment/move operator in order for it to work properly. It also took an extraordinary amount of time to write unit tests for all of my functions. In my game tech class I created a design document for the first phase of an overarching project geared at creating a networked multiplayer game pieced together using pre-existing middleware.

2. **What is in your way?** 
As of right now I have no blockers, aside from writing more cover letters to find an internship for this summer. If anyone has tips or person anecdotes on cover letters, I would love to hear them.

3. **What will you do next week?** 
This week I will begin studying for the upcoming test and start working with my Game Tech team to prototype the single player component of our eventually multiplayer networked game.

**My Impressions:**
I appreciate the level of detail in which Downing covers C++. Despite some prior C++ experience I am learning new things about, and solidifying my understanding of, the language everyday. I took this course in hopes of accomplishing just that.

**Tip of the Week:** 
I started reading a book that covers game programing patterns ([*Game Programming Patterns*](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) by Robert Nystrom) that can be used to organize your code and, thus far, I could not recommend it enough. The patterns discussed do not apply strictly to video games. In fact, it revists some of the design patters from the highly influential classic [*Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides. So if you have been looking for a book that will help improve your code's modularity and coherency, this is the one to check out. It has the added benefit of examples written in C++. You can read the book for free online [here](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html) and the about/homepage for the book is [here](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/).
