1. **What did you do this past week?** Last week I studied for the first exam by coding up segments discussed in class, going over my class notes, the quizzes, and Downing's pages hosted on GitHub. 

2. **What's in your way?** Programming interviews and take home programming assignments.

3. **What will you do next week?** This week I plan to meet with my group to discuss our proposal for the IMDB like website we will be building.
 
**Tip-of-the-week: _Check out [Real-Time Rendering](http://www.realtimerendering.com/) for a list of computer graphics resources. The website hosts a number of resources for a book of the same title._**

The test was reasonably fair. I did not expect multiple in depth questions over topics discussed the day before the test. However, I should have been better prepared for them regardless. Aside from not being familiar with that topic, I felt the test was straight forward. I was annoyed that the it started so late into the evening (half an hour or so before the scheduled time), but the canceled class the next day made up for it. When I took OOP, tests were held in class. Having an hour and 30 minutes gave me ample time to finish. I am excited by the prospects of building a webpage with a team. I have not created a website before and I feel the collaboration and technologies learned during the rest of the class will be particularly helpful for working in industry.
