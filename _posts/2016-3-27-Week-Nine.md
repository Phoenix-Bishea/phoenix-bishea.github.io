1. **What did you do this past week?** 
This week I finished Allocator with my partner, refactored the code base for my Game Technology course, and accepted a summer internship offer with a game company in the Bay Area that I am really looking forward to.

2. **What is in your way?** 
Although the material is very relevant to my field, my weekly algorithms assignments are hindering me from engaging as much as I would like to in certain classes and pursuing personal projects.

3. **What will you do next week?** 
I have already found a partner for Darwin and we will begin working on the project. I will also complete my weekly algorithms assignment, finish the networking portion of my Game Technology course, and apply for the 2D Capstone Video Game Development course.

**My Impressions:**
Working with a partner was a much better experience than working alone. It was twice as easy to work through bugs, write code, and come up with design solutions. I'm looking forward to starting this next project as it sounds like creating a simple video game.

**Tip of the Week:**
Try to reach outside of your immediate profession or specialization when you are networking for jobs and new contacts. That way when your friend, *generic name*, in *insert specialty* hears about an opening for a *insert your profession* specialist, he will go to you, the *insert specialty* Guy/Girl.
