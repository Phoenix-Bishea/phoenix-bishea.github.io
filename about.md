*Game Developer. Dog Lover. Climber of Rocks.*

I am a third-year student at the University of Texas at Austin, pursing a B.A. in Computer Science as well as a certificate in Game Development. Over the summer, I worked as a game development intern for Everi (formerly Multimedia Games) developing video and mechanical slot machine games. I am currently looking for a Summer 2016 internship related to mobile, console or PC game development, as I would like to pursue a career in the industry. 

Last semester, I completed classes in Computer Graphics and Operating Systems and, this spring, I am taking Game Technology, Object-Oriented Programming and Algorithms and Complexity. Outside of classes, I enjoy participating in game jams, making games in Unity, and reading about game engines and computer graphics. Additionally, I am the industry liaison for the game development organization on campus.

When I am not making or learning about video games, I like to go rock climbing and to spend time with my dog and cat, Colbert and Chewbacca.
